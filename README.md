HCPH
This are eclipse projects used to implement a RESTFul API used to access to a database which contains medical records of a 
patient of an emergency event. 

This project uses Hibernate in order to map entities of a relational database to 
Java objects. Additionaly it uses Spring MVC to implement the RESTFul API using standard methods defined inside the
Service and Dao layers.

If properly imported inside your eclipse environment it is posible to deploy TPH.Spring project
in any Java web server and run the RESTFul API and access the methods defined on it.
